A sophisticated AI co-pilot that transforms a one-sentence idea into a comprehensive, actionable startup plan.

The Goal
Millions of people have brilliant ideas but get stuck on the first step. This project solves that initial friction by acting as an instant "founder's mentor," turning a raw thought into a structured, achievable plan.

The Solution
The One-Minute Startup Builder is an interactive web app that takes a single idea and generates a complete business kit. This includes a financial snapshot, a personalized 30-day action plan, and even a script to interview potential customers.

The Innovation
The core of this project is a meticulously engineered multi-module prompt for GPT-4o. Instead of using a static template, the app instructs the AI on how to think‚Äîacting as a consultant, product manager, and mentor to dynamically generate a relevant business strategy and technical roadmap for any idea.

Key Features:
- Instant Startup Brief: Generates a company name, tagline, problem/solution, and target audience.
- Detailed Financial Snapshot: Outlines potential revenue streams and key operational costs.
- Personalized 30-Day Action Plan: A week-by-week checklist that guides a user from idea to validated concept.
- Built-in Customer Interview Guide: Provides a user persona and expertly crafted, non-leading questions to help founders talk to real users.
- Polished & Responsive UI: Features a custom-styled green button that is disabled during processing for clear user feedback.
