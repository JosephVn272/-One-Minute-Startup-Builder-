A fully-featured AI-powered tool that transforms a single sentence idea into a comprehensive, actionable startup plan in under 60 seconds.

üí° About The Project
Millions of people have brilliant ideas but get stuck on the first step. The initial friction of structuring a business concept, defining a target audience, and creating a feature list is often enough to stop a great idea in its tracks. This project was built to solve that problem.

The One-Minute Startup Builder is an interactive web application that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to act as an expert startup consultant and technical project manager. It takes a raw user idea and intelligently generates a complete business brief, including a dynamic, context-aware action plan with specific, relevant tools and instructions.

The core innovation is its dynamic prompt engineering. Instead of using a static template, the app instructs the AI on how to think, enabling it to generate a unique and appropriate development roadmap for any given idea‚Äîfrom a mobile app to an e-commerce brand.

‚ú® Key Features
Dynamic Plan Generation: Creates a unique startup plan for every idea.
Context-Aware Action Plan: Suggests specific tools (like Xcode for iOS apps or Shopify for e-commerce) and instructions relevant to the project type.
Comprehensive Output: Generates everything from company names and taglines to monetization strategies and feature lists.

Interactive UI: A clean, simple, and responsive user interface built with Streamlit.
Downloadable Kit: Allows users to download their generated plan as a .txt file.
