&lt;br>

A sophisticated AI co-pilot that transforms a one-sentence idea into a comprehensive, actionable startup plan.

üéØ The Goal
Millions of people have brilliant ideas but get stuck on the first step. This project solves that initial friction by acting as an instant "founder's mentor," turning a raw thought into a structured, achievable plan.

‚ú® The Solution
The One-Minute Startup Builder is an interactive web app that takes a single idea and generates a complete business kit. This includes a financial snapshot, a personalized 30-day action plan, and even a script to interview potential customers.

üß† The Innovation
The core of this project is a meticulously engineered multi-module prompt for GPT-4o. Instead of using a static template, the app instructs the AI on how to think‚Äîacting as a consultant, product manager, and mentor to dynamically generate a relevant business strategy and technical roadmap for any idea.

Key Features:

- Instant Startup Brief: Generates a company name, tagline, problem/solution, and target audience.
- Detailed Financial Snapshot: Outlines potential revenue streams and key operational costs.
- Personalized 30-Day Action Plan: A week-by-week checklist that guides a user from idea to validated concept.
- Built-in Customer Interview Guide: Provides a user persona and expertly crafted, non-leading questions to help founders talk to real users.
- Polished & Responsive UI: Features a custom-styled green button that is disabled during processing for clear user feedback.
